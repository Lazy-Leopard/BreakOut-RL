Abstract :

Applying Reinforcement Learning to basic tasks has been quite a hot topic of interest in the last decade, especially for the second part.One of the basic steps is to begin implementing different algorithms related to it,to basic Games.Classic Arcade Game Enviornments have achieved a special attention towards themselves as a test bed  for these kind of algorithms.My aim is to implement a couple of algorithms , basically a modified form of DQN and A3C and make these algorithms play the famous Arcade Game of Breakout.

Introduction:

I have written model-free codes which can be applied to different enviorments,as our agent may decide its policy based on the game enviornment using the specified algorithms, and will be learning through a certain balance of exploration,i.e. learning  through trials, and exploitation,i.e. learning through the past experiences.
